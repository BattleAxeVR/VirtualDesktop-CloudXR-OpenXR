# PimaxXR: an OpenXR runtime for Pimax headsets

This program is a Windows OpenXR runtime for Pimax headsets. It allows you to run OpenXR applications without SteamVR. It is not produced by Pimax.

It is built on top of the official Pimax PVR native SDK and aims to provide a very fast and efficient implementation of the OpenXR standard for Pimax headsets.

DISCLAIMER: This runtime is not officially conformant per Khronos standards: it cannot be called "conformant" nor use the OpenXR trademark and logo. However, the runtime passes the majority of OpenXR conformance tests and the reason for not seeking official conformance is the required $30,000 adopter fee.

DISCLAIMER: This software is distributed as-is, without any warranties or conditions of any kind. Use at your own risks.
