# An implementation of the OpenXR standard for Virtual Desktop

This program is an implementation of the OpenXR standard for Virtual Desktop on Windows. It allows you to run OpenXR applications without SteamVR.

DISCLAIMER: This runtime is not officially conformant per Khronos standards: it cannot be called "conformant" nor use the OpenXR trademark and logo. However, the runtime passes the majority of OpenXR conformance tests and the reason for not seeking official conformance is the required $30,000 adopter fee.

DISCLAIMER: This software is distributed as-is, without any warranties or conditions of any kind. Use at your own risks.
